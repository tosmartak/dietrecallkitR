# dietrecallkit Package - R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**dietrecallkit** is a cross-platform package designed to enhance the efficiency of researchers and analysts in cleaning, processing, and calculating complex dietary and nutrient indicators from dietary recall data. Built for both **Python** and **R**, it provides tools to streamline workflows, ensuring accurate and reproducible results in dietary and nutrition-related studies.

---

## **Key Features**
- Efficient cleaning of data collected using the built in XLSForm
- Efficient computation of nutrient and dietary indicators.
- Compatible with **Python** and **R**, catering to a wide range of researchers. ([See Python Repository](https://github.com/tosmartak/dietrecallkitPy))
- Designed for reproducibility and accuracy in research.
- Simplifies complex calculations, saving time and effort.

---

## **Who Is This For?**
- **Nutrition Researchers**: Calculate indicators for dietary assessments with ease.
- **Data Analysts**: Streamline workflows for nutrient analysis.
- **Academics and Students**: Learn and apply dietary metrics in a research-ready framework.

## Installation in R

You can install the development version of dietrecallkit from [GitHub](https://github.com/tosmartak/dietrecallkitR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tosmartak/dietrecallkitR")
```

or install from R-CRAN with

```r
install.packages("dietrecallkit")
```

## Quick Start

### Example

The package comes with a lightweight, relational example dataset called dietrecall_example. This dataset contains three linked tables: `maintable`, `food_details`, and `food_ingredients_group` similar to what you would have when you used the dietary recall questionnaire from the 24hour recall toolkit.

Note: the dataset is just a sample and not a real dataset and must be loaded explicitly with data() since LazyData is set to false‚Äù. Ideally this should be replaced with your own dataset

```{r example}
# Load the package after installation
library(dietrecallkit)

# Load the example dataset
data("dietrecall_example")

# Explore maintable
knitr::kable(head(dietrecall_example$maintable))

# Linked food details
knitr::kable(head(dietrecall_example$food_details))
```
