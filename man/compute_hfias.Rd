\title{Compute Household Food Insecurity Access (HFIA) Score and Category}
\usage{
compute_hfias(data, hfia_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing HFIAS-related variables.}

\item{hfia_cols}{A character vector specifying the ordered column names
corresponding to the HFIAS questions. These should include both occurrence
(Yes/No) and frequency responses, alternating in sequence.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the original data with two added columns:
\code{hfia_score} and \code{hfia_category}.
}
\description{
This function computes the HFIA score and categorical classification
(1–4) based on the standard HFIAS indicator framework developed by
FANTA (Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project). The function
assumes that the HFIAS-related variables are provided in the exact order
they appear in the HFIAS questionnaire (occurrence and frequency pairs).
}
\details{
The function expects 18 columns for the standard HFIAS tool:
nine occurrence questions and nine corresponding frequency-of-occurrence
questions, ordered as:
\enumerate{
\item Occurrence Q1
\item Frequency Q1
\item Occurrence Q2
\item Frequency Q2
\item ... up to Q9 and its frequency
}

Expected frequency responses:
\itemize{
\item "Rarely (1-2 times)" = 1
\item "Sometimes (3 to 10 times)" = 2
\item "Often (more than 10 times)" = 3
}
and occurrence responses:
\itemize{
\item "Yes" = 1
\item "No" = 0
}

Numeric inputs are accepted directly (0–3). Missing values are automatically
replaced with 0, as frequency questions are typically skipped when occurrence
is "No." After conversion, the function checks for any unexpected text entries
and raises an informative error listing them for the user to clean.

\strong{Outputs:}
\itemize{
\item \code{hfia_score} — The total sum of the nine frequency columns.
\item \code{hfia_category} — A categorical classification:
\describe{
\item{1}{Food secure}
\item{2}{Mildly food insecure}
\item{3}{Moderately food insecure}
\item{4}{Severely food insecure}
}
}
